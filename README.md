- **DISARM Framework**: Captures attack patterns in terms of phases, tactics, and techniques.
- **Risk Assessment**: Supports the evaluation of disinformation risk levels.
- **Research Utility**: Aids in understanding and mitigating disinformation threats.

## Dataset Contents

- **Phases**: Various stages of disinformation campaigns.
- **Tactics**: Methods used by threat actors during different phases.
- **Techniques**: Specific actions taken to implement tactics.

## Applications

- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate and prioritize disinformation threats.
- **Threat Actor Analysis**: Understand behaviors and strategies of threat actors.
- **Academic Research**: Support studies in cybersecurity and disinformation analysis.
- **Policy Making**: Inform strategies for countering disinformation campaigns.

## Usage

1. **Download the Dataset**: Obtain the dataset from the repository.
